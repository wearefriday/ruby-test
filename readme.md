# We are Friday. Are you?

We've put together this test to help us when hiring new Engineers. It is deliberately open-ended, and we don’t expect you to spend longer than a couple of hours.

## Aim
We love NASA. You probably do too. They release a lot of code on Github (https://github.com/nasa) ranging from networking authentication to snowmelt forecasting and beyond.

We’d like you to create an interactive page that uses the GitHub API to demonstrate the variety of programming languages they use across their repositories. We don’t expect you to be a designer, but bonus points for making something interesting that looks nice.

## Technologies
We'd like to see you use technologies that you'd be using daily in your job at Friday: Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Cucumber, HTTP libraries. We’re not fussed about which combinations you choose, so long as you can explain your choices.

Please provide a comprehensive README to help your colleagues collaborate on the project with you.

Good luck and remember, this is as much about how you get to the outcome as the outcome itself.

## What we're looking for
* How you interrogate requirements
* The end result in the browser
* How you use third party services (clients, error handling and testing/mocking)
* How you communicate using commit messages and documentation
